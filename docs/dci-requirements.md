# Data Controller for SASÂ® - System Requirements

## Overview
The Data Controller is a SAS Stored Process Web Application, deployed into an existing SAS platform, and as such has no special requirements beyond what is typically available in a SAS Foundation environment.

## Backend
A SAS Foundation deployment of at least 9.4M3 must be available. Earlier versions of SAS can be supported, on request.  A SAS Stored Process Server must be configured, running under a system account.

## Mid-Tier
A web server with `/SASLogon` and the SAS SPWA must be available to end users

## Frontend
All major browsers supported, including IE11 (earlier versions of IE may not work properly).
For IE, note that [compatibility view](dci-troubleshooting#Internet Explorer - blank screen) must be disabled.
