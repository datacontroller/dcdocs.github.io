# Data Controller for SASÂ® - Adding Tables

## Overview

Adding tables to the Data Controller is a matter of configuration, specifically the addition of a new record to the `DATACTRL.MPE_TABLES` table, and corresponding entries in the `DATACTRL.MPE_SECURITY` table.

!!! note
    In order to surface the table to (non admin) users, appropriate groups should be configured as per [security](dcc-security.md) settings.

## MPE_TABLES Configuration Details

Each table to be edited in the Data Controller is represented by one record in `DATACTRL.MPE_TABLES`. The fields should be populated as follows:

### LIBREF

The libref of the table. If not pre-assigned, and the serverType is SAS 9 (EBI), DC will assign it at runtime using the first definition found in metadata, using this [macro](https://core.sasjs.io/mm__assigndirectlib_8sas.html).

### DSN

The dataset (table) name as visible when assigning a direct libref connection to `LIBREF`.  If the target is a format catalog, it should have a "-FC" suffice (eg `FORMATS-FC`).  More info on formats [here](formats.md).

### NUM_OF_APPROVALS_REQUIRED

This is an integer representing the number of approvals required before a table is updated. This mechanism lets you insist on, for example, 2 or 3 approvals before sensitive data is updated following a submission. Note that only one rejection is ever necessary to remove the submission.
This is a required field.

### LOADTYPE

The loadtype determines the nature of the update to be applied. Valid values are as follows:

- UPDATE. This is the most basic type, and any updates will happen 'in place'. Simply provide the primary key fields in the `BUSKEY` column.
- TXTEMPORAL. This signifies an SCD2 type load. For this type the validity fields (valid from, valid to) should be specified in the `VAR_TXFROM` and `VAR_TXTO` fields. The table itself should include `VAR_TXFROM` in the physical key. The remainder of the primary key fields (not including `VAR_TXFROM`) should be specified in `BUSKEY`.
- BITEMPORAL. These tables have two time dimensions - a version history, and a business history. The version history (SCD2) fields should be specified in `VAR_TXFROM` and `VAR_TXTO` and the business history fields should be specified in `VAR_BUSFROM` and `VAR_BUSTO`. The `VAR_TXFROM` and `VAR_BUSFROM` fields should be in the key of the actual table, but should not be also specified in the `BUSKEY` field.

This is a required field.
!!! Note
    The support for BITEMPORAL loads is restricted, in the sense it is only possible to load data at a single point in time (no support for loading multiple business date ranges for a single business key). The workaround is simply to load each date range separately.

### BUSKEY

The business (natural) key of the table. For SCD2 / Bitemporal, this does NOT include the validity dates. For Retained / Surrogate key tables, this contains the actual surrogate key - the underlying fields that are used to create the surrogate key are specified in [RK_UNDERLYING](#rk_underlying).
This is a required field.

### VAR_TXFROM / VAR_TXTO

The SCD2 type validity dates, representing the point in time at which the field was created (`VAR_TXFROM`) and when it was closed out (`VAR_TXTO`) from a change or deletion. If the record is active, the `VAR_TXTO` field would contain a high value. `VAR_TXFROM` is a part of the physical key of the underlying table.
These fields should contain the NAME of the variables which contain the open / close timestamps in the underlying table.
Leave blank if not required.

### VAR_BUSFROM / VAR_BUSTO

The BITEMPORAL _business_ dates which represent the reporting period to which the record is valid. Typically these contain _date_ values (rather than _datetime_ values). If variables are specified here, then the [LOADTYPE](#loadtype) should be `BITEMPORAL`.
Leave blank if not required.

### VAR_PROCESSED

Set the name of a variable (eg `processed_dttm`) which should be given a current timestamp whenever the table is updated.
Leave blank if not required.

### CLOSE_VARS

By default, the Data Controller will only process the records that are part of a changeset. This means that records should be explicity marked for deletion. But what if you are performing a reload of a monthly batch, and the _absence_ of a record implies that it is no longer required? For this scenario, it is necessary to specify the range within a 'complete' load is expected. For instance, by reporting month, or month + product. When performing loads, the DC will then first extract a distinct list of values for this key and close them out in the target table, before performing the upload. The `CLOSE_VARS` are typically a subset of the [BUSKEY](#buskey) fields.
Leave blank if not required.

### PRE_EDIT_HOOK

The location of code to execute prior to an edit being made. This allows for modification of the data before it is presented for editing. Leave blank if not required.  Configuration details are [here](#hook-scripts).

#### SAS Developer Notes
The PRE_EDIT_HOOK program will be `%inc`'d _after_ the data has been extracted.  A table called `work.out` will be available, containing all the same columns (in the same order) as normally shown on the EDIT screen on the frontend.  The observations will have been sorted on the [BUSKEY](#buskey).  The surrounding code looks like this:

![pre edit hook SAS code](https://i.imgur.com/ezQWU4W.png)

You can make any changes you wish, just be sure that the final table is also called `work.out`.


### POST_EDIT_HOOK

This [hook script](#hook-scripts) is `%include`'d _after_ an edit has been made. This is useful when there is a need to augment data, or perform advanced data quality checks prior to approval.

Leave blank if not required.

#### SAS Developer Notes 

The `&orig_libds` macro variable contains a reference to the base library.table or format catalog that will be loaded (on approval).  The staged table is called `work.STAGING_DS`. 

If your DQ check means that the program should not be submitted, then simply exit with `&syscc > 4`. You can even set a message to go back to the user by using the [mp_abort](https://core.sasjs.io/mp__abort_8sas.html) macro:

```
%mp_abort(iftrue= (&syscc ne 0) /* if this condition is true, the process will exit */
  ,msg=%str(YOUR MESSAGE GOES HERE)
)
```


### PRE_APPROVE_HOOK

This [hook script](#hook-scripts) is `%inc`'d before the approval diff is generated. It can be used to modify the values presented to an approver on the approve screen.  This can be helpful in order to present the data in way that can be easily consumed by approvers.

Leave blank if not required.

### POST_APPROVE HOOK

This [hook script](#hook-scripts) is `%inc`'d _after_ an approval is made. This is the most common type of hook script, and is useful for, say, running a SAS job after a mapping table is updated, or running a model after changing a parameter.  

Leave blank if not required.

#### SAS Developer Notes 

The `&orig_libds` macro variable contains a reference to the library.table (or format catalog) that has just been loaded.  The staged table is called `work.STAGING_DS`. 


### SIGNOFF_COLS

Used to determine a range (eg reporting month) to which a 'final version' can be marked. This allows a particular version of data to be marked as final, meaning that the data can continue to change afterwards (reports can simply query for the timestamp of the 'final' version of the data).
Leave blank if not required.

### SIGNOFF_HOOK

This [hook script](#hook-scripts) is `%inc`'d after a 'final version' has been signed off.

Leave blank if not required.

### NOTES

Content entered here will be displayed to the approver on signoff.
Not required, but recommended.

### RK_UNDERLYING

For retained / surrogate keys, an auto-incrementing field is used to represent each unique record. In this case, the RK (integer) field itself should be added in the [BUSKEY](#buskey) column, and the natural / underlying key should be added here.
Leave blank unless using retained / surrogate keys.

### HELPFUL_LINK

If more information is available to describe the table being updated (eg on sharepoint), provide a url here and it will be made available to approvers.
Leave blank if not required.


## HOOK Scripts

Data Controller allows SAS programs to be executed at certain points in the ingestion lifecycle, such as:

* Before an edit (to control the edit screen)
* After an edit (perform complex data quality)
* Before an approval (control the approve screen)
* After an approval (trigger downstream jobs with new data)

The code is simply `%include`'d at the relevant point during backend execution. The program may be:

* Physical, ie the full path to a `.sas` program on the physical server directory
* Logical, ie a Viya Job (SAS Drive), SAS 9 Stored Process (Metadata Folder) or SASJS Stored Program (SASjs Drive).

If the entry ends in ".sas" it is assumed to be a physical, filesystem file.  Otherwise, the source code is extracted from the Job/STP.  The Job/STP path can be relative (beneath the /DataController root) or full (to another item in Drive / Metadata).
