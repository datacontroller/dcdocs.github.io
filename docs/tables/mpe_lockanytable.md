# MPE_LOCKANYTABLE

The `MPE_LOCKANYTABLE` table provides a mechanism for a process to secure a logical 'lock' on an object to avoid conflicts when running the application with multiple users in parallel. 

The underlying utility is open source and documented [here](https://core.sasjs.io/mp__lockanytable_8sas.html).

For more information, see the [locking mechanism guide](https://docs.datacontroller.io/locking-mechanism).
