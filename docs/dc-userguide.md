<h1> Data Controller for SAS: User Guide </h1>

## What does the Data Controller do?

The Data Controller for SAS allows user to add, modify data. All changes are staged and approved before being applied to the target table. The review process, as well as using generic and repeatable code to perform updates, helps to ensure data integrity.

#What is a Target Table?
A Target Table is a physical table, such as a SAS dataset or a Table in a database. The attributes of this table (eg Primary Key, loadtype, library, SCD variables etc) will have been predefined by your administrator so that you can change the data in that table safely and easily.
