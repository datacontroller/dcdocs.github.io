# Data Controller for SAS: User Guide 

## Overview

The Data Controller has 5 tabs, as follows:

* Viewer.  This tab lets users view any table to which they have been granted access in metadata.  They can also download the data as csv, excel, or as a SAS program (datalines).
* Editor.  This tab enables users to add, modify or delete data. This can be done directly in the browser, or by uploading a CSV file. Values can also be copy-pasted from a spreadsheet. Once changes are ready, they can be submitted, with a corresponding reason.
* Submissions.  This shows and editor the outstanding changes that have been submitted for approval (but have not yet been approved or rejected).
* Approvals.  This shows an approver all the outstanding changes that are waiting to be approved.
* History.  This shows an auditor, or other interested party, what changes have been submitted for each table over time.
