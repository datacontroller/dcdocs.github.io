Data Controller Videos
====================

A collection of videos made in relation to Data Controller.  Some of them were recorded on earlier versions, hence the slight UI differences.  


## Full Table Search
Data Controller for SAS®  enables full text search on Global CASLIB tables (and SAS 9 tables too)

## Data Viewer
Data Controller for SAS® isn't just for editing (and approving) data - it can also be used to query and download!

## Data Lineage
Data Lineage is one of the most powerful features of DI Studio generated ETL.  This tool queries it and makes a graphical output to help DI Developers, Data Modellers, and Business Analysts understand the data from both Source to Target and Target to Source.

### Table Level
Table level lineage shows tables (colour coded per library) and associated jobs (with links to metadata definitions)

### Column Level
Column level lineage shows the transformations and any business logic applied to each variable during the flow.  Data items are distinguished between files, database tables, and SAS datasets.

## Email Alerts
Adding Email Alerts in Data Controller is a case of updating the MPE_ALERTS table (to say which alerts you wish to send) and the MPE_EMAILS table (only if your emails are not stored in metadata)

## Deploying Data Controller
The SAS 9 evaluation version of the Data Controller comes packaged in a single SPK, which can be deployed in under 30 seconds!

## Uploading a CSV and Downloading Datalines
This video demonstrates 2 features in 30 seconds!

1 - File uploads.  Data Controller will let you upload CSVs (using any common separator) to any target table without having to specify variable formats etc in advance.  Changes are routed through the usual approval process with audit trail.

2 SAS File downloads.  Other than standard CSV / Excel files, it's possible to download a SAS program containing the data in datalines format.  This enables SAS developers to easily work with copies of the data, for testing and development purposes.

## Locked Datasets

In unix environments, when attempting to edit a locked table, users are notified with regard to which PID contains the lock.
