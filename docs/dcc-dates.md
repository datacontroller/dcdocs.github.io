# Data Controller for SASÂ® - Dates & Datetimes

## Overview

Dates & datetimes are actually stored as plain numerics in regular SAS tables. In order for the Data Controller to recognise these values as dates / datetimes a format must be applied.

This format must also be present / updated in the metadata view of the (physical) table to be displayed properly.  This can be done using DI Studio, or by running the following (template) code:

```
proc metalib;
  omr (library="Your Library");
  folder="/Shared Data/your table storage location";
  update_rule=(delete);
run;
```
