# Data Controller for SASÂ® - Adding Groups

## Overview
By default, Data Controller will work with the SAS Groups defined in metadata.  It is also possible to define custom groups with Data Controller itself - to do this simply add the user and group name (and optionally, a group description) in the `DATACTRL.MPE_GROUPS` table.
